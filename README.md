# Assignment 2: Control Structures in Python

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate the use of control structures as part of **Module 3: Control Structures in Python**.

## ✅ Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

**Filename:** `Assignment2_Task1.py`

### Description:
This script:
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Uses an `if-else` control structure to determine whether the number is even or odd.
- Displays a corresponding message to the user.

### Sample Output:
Enter an integer: 7
The number is odd.

## 🔁 Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

**Filename:** `Assignment2_Task2.py`

### Description:
This script:
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50.
- Calculates and prints the sum of these integers.

### Sample Output:
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
